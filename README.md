Downloading a single file from a website is simply easy and does not require a tutorial whatsoever. Where it  becomes a daunting task is when you need to download multiple files of say hundreds or thousands. For most employees, a big percentage of their daily tasks involve downloading files and then the files are stitched together for a report or analysis.

In this short tutorial, I will show how you can download one year stock price data from yahoo finance for multiple companies using their ticker symbols. Python and the selenium package were used to automate this process. You could use the same code to  download any other file type. 

If you want to try your hands on the process copy the code from my Github page. Credit to Artur Spirin for a a piece of code
